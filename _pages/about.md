I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Maryland, majoring in computer science, under the guidance of [Prof. MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.

My primary research area is theoretical computer science, with a focus on designing algorithms for graph problems. Additionally, I am exploring computational complexity theory, particularly in generating hard instances with various applications in quantum computing.
