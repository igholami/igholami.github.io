I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Maryland, majoring in computer science, under the guidance of [Prof. MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.

My primary research area is theoretical computer science,
focusing on designing algorithms for problems in network design, graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and social choice theory.
Additionally, I am exploring computational complexity theory, particularly in generating hard instances with applications in quantum computing.
