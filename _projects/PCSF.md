From the beginning of my Ph.D. program, I have been working on a network design problem called _Prize-Collecting Steiner Forests_. I have read several papers on this topic and collaborated with a group of researchers.

Throughout this project, I faced several challenges, including defining research directions, coordinating teamwork, breaking down the problem into manageable steps, and meeting deadlinesâ€”even when the work seemed overwhelming.

As a result of this project, I have published several papers and gained a deeper understanding of the problem and the state of the art. Our publications include:

- **JACM:** [2-Approximation for Prize-Collecting Steiner Forest](https://doi.org/10.1145/3722551)
- **IPCO 2025:** [Prize-Collecting Forest with Submodular Penalties: Improved Approximation](https://ipco25.cs.jhu.edu/accepted/)
- **STOC 2024:** [Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree: A 1.79 Approximation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3618260.3649789)
